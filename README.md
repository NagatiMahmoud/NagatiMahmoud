As a Data Center and Azure Cloud Administrator within the Ministry, I lead critical cloud infrastructure projects, ensuring secure and reliable operations for all departments. I oversee the migration of systems to Azure HCI, while integrating DevOps practices such as AKS orchestration and CI/CD automation.  

A graduate of ENSI in computer engineering, I am also Microsoft Azure certified (AZ-305, AZ-104, AZ-500). My goal is to design scalable and secure cloud solutions, while optimizing operational efficiency and strengthening the cybersecurity posture of the organizations I support.
